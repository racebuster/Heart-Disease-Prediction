##### Source
This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations
  
##### Total: 1190 observations
##### Duplicated: 272 observations
##### Final dataset: 918 observations

Every dataset used can be found under the Index of heart disease datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository on the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/
